# HTTP Requests for API Testing

This directory contains HTTP request files that can be used to test the Restaurant Booking API. These files are designed to be used with tools like Visual Studio Code (with the REST Client extension), IntelliJ IDEA, or any other tool that supports `.http` files.

## Files Organization

- `00_health_check.http` - Basic health check requests to verify the server is running
- `01_restaurants.http` - Requests for restaurant management
- `02_availability.http` - Requests for restaurant availability management
- `03_users.http` - Requests for user management
- `04_bookings.http` - Requests for booking management
- `05_complete_workflow.http` - A complete workflow showcasing the entire booking process

## How to Use

1. Make sure the server is running (`make up`)
2. If using VS Code, install the "REST Client" extension
3. Open any of the `.http` files
4. Replace the placeholder variables as needed:
   - `replace_with_restaurant_id`
   - `replace_with_user_id`
   - `replace_with_booking_id`
   - `replace_with_alternative_id`
5. Click on "Send Request" above each request to execute it

### Sequential Testing

For step-by-step testing:

1. Start with `00_health_check.http` to ensure the server is running
2. Use `01_restaurants.http` to create a restaurant and note the returned ID
3. Use `02_availability.http` to set availability (update the restaurant ID)
4. Use `03_users.http` to create a user and note the returned ID
5. Use `04_bookings.http` to test booking functionality (update restaurant and user IDs)

Alternatively, use `05_complete_workflow.http` for a guided, sequential testing process that automatically captures IDs from responses.

## Dynamic Variables

The `.http` files support dynamic variables to capture values from responses:

```http
### Step 1: Create a restaurant
# @name createRestaurant
POST {{baseUrl}}/restaurants
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "La Trattoria",
  ...
}

### Extract restaurant ID from response
@restaurantId = {{createRestaurant.response.body.id}}
```

This allows for chaining requests without manually copying IDs.

## Notes

- The default base URL is `http://localhost:8080/api/v1`
- All dates are in the format YYYY-MM-DD
- IDs will be UUIDs generated by the server
